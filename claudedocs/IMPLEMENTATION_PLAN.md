# Leadomi SIP maintenance and release procedure

This document describes maintenance of the implemented business system rather
than a legacy roadmap. Do not present retained experimental code as a shipped
feature. Preserve provider connections, phone passwords and existing volumes.

1. Read the current operational/API guides and capture a verified backup.
2. Implement changes with explicit number-review boundaries and no startup
   provider writes. Cover provisioning guards, session revocation, attribution
   snapshots and private bridge behavior with meaningful tests.
3. Build Vue/TypeScript; run Go API/DB/SIP/startup tests; use isolated fake-provider
   and PBX integration tests without paid calls/SMS. Scan reachable dependency
   vulnerabilities when changing dependencies.
4. Push the reviewed revision, deploy to the existing app, verify service health,
   read-only callback mappings and existing SIP authentication. Reconnect phones.
5. Let the operator perform paid manual acceptance tests. Verify backups after
   deployment and keep external recovery copies. Document remaining limitations.
